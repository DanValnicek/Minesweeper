# Multiplayer Minesweeper

This project was a technical part of my high school leaving examination. It is a minesweeper game with battle royale game mode. 
Written in Java 14 with JavaFX

In multiplayer players get the same map and compete to solve the map in shortest time possible without being eliminated by uncovering a mine. 
When the first player finishes the game will start a 30 second timer for other players. If the other players don't finish in time they will also be eliminated. 
The rest of players will continue to next round until there is only one player left.
